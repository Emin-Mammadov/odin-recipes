<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and garlic; sprinkle with salt, black pepper, rosemary, and basil. Arrange chicken in
        a large baking dish and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
